This screenshot shows how the quiz game in edit mode. Questions, options/notes and answer need to be provided in a text file called questions.txt in the same directory as the presentation.
The file uses a special notation. Please find more details on the instructions slide. 

Please note that the presentation can be stopped during the game. State is preserved. This allows for editing / correction during the game. The game can simply be continued by resuming the presentation. 

The subdirectory "scripts" contains the exported code. It is not needed for running the quiz game. 

In order to use the quiz game you can simply ... 
1. download "quiz.pptm", 
2. open it with MS Powerpoint
3. enter your questions in a questions.txt file in the specified way in the same directory as the presentation,
4. run the presentation
5. click on the star on the first non-empty slide in order to start / reset the game.

Everything else should be self-explanatory. 

*Please note that this is my first Power Point VBA project. So don't consider any of the code / technique used to be best practice. In any case, I am always open for learning and I am looking forward to your feedback.*
