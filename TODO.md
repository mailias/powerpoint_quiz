1. __Random question association:__

    Optional possibility to define questions without order and to associate them randomly to the buttons.

1. __Adjust text to frame:__ 

    Resize question, note and answer text to fit the text frame (the respective formatting option does not seem to be applied for text that is inserted via VBA).

1. __One slide per question:__

    Generate a slide for each question instead of using one generic slide (this would allow for manually editing each slide e.g. adding specific images).
